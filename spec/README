Some of the tests expect mysql2, which in-turn depends on mysql.

If you'd rather not install mysql, you can just comment out the mysql2 development dependency in seed-fu.gemspec.

If you'd like to be able to run tests in MySQL, then you may need it installed for the mysql2 gem to compile.

In OS X, if you use Homebrew, to install you might use:

  brew install mysql

Now that we're finally done with that, to run the specs:

  gem install bundler # If not already installed
  bundle install      # Install the dependencies
  rspec spec/         # Run the specs

By default an sqlite3 database is used.

To test others:

  DB=mysql rspec spec/
  DB=postgresql rspec spec/

In each of these cases, you'll need to create a database named "spec_fu_test".

The connection parameters for each of these are specified in spec/connections/, which you can edit if necessary, e.g. to change the username/password.
