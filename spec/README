To run the specs:

  gem install bundler # If not already installed
  bundle install      # Install the dependencies
  rspec spec/         # Run the specs

By default an sqlite3 database is used.

To test others:

  DB=mysql rspec spec/
  DB=postgresql rspec spec/

In each of these cases, you'll need to create a database named "seed_fu_test".

The connection paramaters for each of these are specified in spec/connections/, which you can edit if necessary (for example to change the username/password).
